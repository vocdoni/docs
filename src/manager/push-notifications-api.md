# Push notifications service

The push notifications service allows organizations to send pop up messages to their users devices. Organizations can send notifications at any time and their users do not have to be in the app or using their devices to receive them.

Currently the push notifications system used is the Google Firebase Cloud Messassing but any other provider can be easily integrated.

Each user can be subscribed to any organization she wants and be notified for one or more events.

Event subscription is managed with a topic approach, currently supporting the following topics:
- `<entityID>_default_post-new`
- `<entityID>_default_process-new`


## Ethereum

Given that the Vocdoni platform uses different smart contracts deployed into an EVM compatible chain as the source of truth, it is a requirement to have access to an Ethereum JSON-RPC compatible endpoint in order to interact with these contracts.
Interacting with this contracts means to read, write and listen for events.

Some examples:
- New voting process creation
- A voting process is ended
- An ended voting process have the results available
- ...

Currently supported contract events: `NewProcess(bytes32 processId, uint16 namespace)`

## IPFS

Another fundamental component of the notifications service is the IPFS node. Data is not stored in Ethereum but in IPFS, and given so, have access to an IPFS node is required in order to retrieve and store data in this distributed file system.

This data can be:
- Voting process metadata (type, mode, questions ...)
- Organization metadata (name, email, ID ...)
- Preferred organization bootnodes and gateways to connect with

The actual URI of this data is stored on Ethereum and changes every time any of the data is changed. This is an IPFS property which is a content-addressed system.

Currently supported file changes: News feed modifications on organizations metadata

## Notifications service

The notifications service, in short, has two main different missions:

1. To track the`Process` smart contract events
    
    Example: An organization created a new process and wants to inform its members

2. To track IPFS files changes given its URI stored in Ethereum

    Example: An organization updated its news feed entry and wants to notify its members that a new post is added
    
    
Is composed by the following components:

### How it works

- **Private database**

    This database is used to get the organizations list and be able to track each ones metadata.

- **Ethereum**

    The Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint is used to interact with the Ethereum network, the `Process` contract and the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)
    are those the notifications service uses.
    
    - The ENS smart contracts are used to fetch the canonical `Process` smart contract address under the `voting-process.vocdoni.eth` domain.
    - Once the `Process` contract address is fetched a component called `ethEvents` starts to listen for logs on the contract.
    - Each time a new process is created (the case currently supported) an Ethereum smart contract event is triggered and the `ethEvents` component
      handles it.
    - The event will be processed and a notification announcing the creation of a process will be created and sended to Firebase.
    - The users subscribed to the corresponding topic will receive the notification
      

- **IPFS**

    The IPFS file tracking also relies on Ethereum as a source of truth and uses Ethereum to get the latest IPFS URI in the ENS Text List Record
    entry of an organization. This IPFS URI points to the entity metadata.
    As said, this metadata is stored on IPFS and its content is univocally identified by a hash.
    
    The file tracking mechanism works as follows:
    - Get the organizations list from the private database.
    - Get each entity IPFS metadata URI from the ENS Text list record corresponding entry.
    - Fetch the file from IPFS:
        - If the organization was not tracked before, just store the file and its hash.
        - Else the current hash is compared with the previously stored ones and if it is different the content is also different.
    - In case of the metadata was updated the current version checks if the news feed field is different.
    - Each time the news feed is modified a new Firebase notification is created.
    - The users subscribed to the corresponding topic will be notified that a new post is created or updated.

    This process runs forever and is repeated every scheduled time. 
          

## API

The notifications API is used to generate user tokens that can be useful for certain circumstances.

Available by default under `/notifications`

The API methods below follow the [JSON API](/architecture/protocol/json-api) specifications.

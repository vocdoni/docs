# Off-chain Census

Off-chain census allow organizations to manager their voting body with varying levels of privacy and user interaction. Off-chain is the best solution for traditional organizations in the non-crypto space. The simplest method is CSV census, which is used by [Vocdoni.app](https://vocdoni.app/), and allows entities to manage their user base on a single private spreadsheet. At the other end of complexity is a registry database solution which is managed by the hosting organization and requires users to pre-register before a voting process.

# Census Integration

The Voting Protocol requires a [Census Merkle Tree](../../architecture/census-overview.md) to be created and published before an organization can host a voting process. There are two main types of census, as well as two sub-types: 
+ [on-chain](on-chain.md) 
+ [off-chain](off-chain.md)
  + [CSV](csv.md)
  + [registry database](registry.md)

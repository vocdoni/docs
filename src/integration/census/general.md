# Census Integration

The Voting Protocol requires a [Census](../../architecture/census/census-overview.md) to be created and published before an organization can host a voting process. 

The [Census Origin](../../architecture/smart-contracts/process.md#census-origin) must also be set to signify which type of census the process will use. 

There are two main types of census: 
+ [on-chain](on-chain.md) 
+ [off-chain](off-chain.md)

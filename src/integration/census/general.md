# Census Integration

The Voting Protocol requires a [Census Merkle Tree](../../architecture/census-overview.md) to be created and published before an organization can host a voting process. There are three main types of census: 
+ [on-chain](on-chain.md) 
+ [off-chain CSV](csv.md)
+ [off-chain registry database](registry.md).

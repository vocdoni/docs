# Off-chain CSP Census

Off-chain Credential Service Provider (CSP) census allows for users to be dynamically verified throughout the duration of a voting process. Integrators must set up (or choose) a CSP which validates voters with some third-party mechanism. For example, an organization could work with their local governmental authority to set up a CSP which validates any user who can prove they live within the given jurisdiction. Such a CSP would be in charge of determining their own validation method, and would approve user credentials based on the [off-chain CSP census](../../architecture/census/off-chain-csp.md) specification.

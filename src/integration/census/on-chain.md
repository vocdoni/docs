# On-chain Census

:::tip
This is the census mechanism used by [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org/)
:::

On-chain census are defined as part of the Voting Protocol, so organizations using this method do not need to generate their own Census Merkle Tree. Rather, the Merkle Tree is an [Ethereum Storage Proof](../../architecture/smart-contracts/storage-proofs.md) and the census is a weighted set of holders of a given Ethereum token.

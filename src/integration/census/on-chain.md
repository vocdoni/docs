# On-chain Census

:::tip
This is the census mechanism used by [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org/)
:::

[On-chain census](../../architecture/census/on-chain.md) are defined as part of the Voting Protocol, so organizations using this method do not need to generate their own Census Merkle Tree. Rather, the Merkle Tree is an [Ethereum Storage Proof](../../architecture/smart-contracts/storage-proofs.md) and the census is a weighted set of holders of a given Ethereum token.

On-chain census is more thoroughly documented at the [Census Overview](../../architecture/census/census-overview.md) and Ethereum Storage Proof pages.

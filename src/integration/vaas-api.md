## Integrator API (Private)

**Integrator related**

---

The following endpoints are authenticated by using the integrator secret key. They allow integrators to manage the organizations related to their customers. 

### Create an organization

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
This request submits a transaction to the [voting blockchain](../architecture/services/vochain.md) which can take some time (~15 seconds) to be accepted and mined. Therefore, the return values of this method should not be considered valid until the Transaction Status method is called, using the `txHash` value to confirm that the desired transaction has been mined. Only then is it safe to query for the organization you have created. 

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <integrator-key>" https://server/v1/priv/account/organizations
```

#### Request body
```json
{
    "name": "Organization name",
    "description": "my-description",
    "header": "https://my/header.jpeg",

}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "organizationId": "0x1234...",
    "apiToken": "pub_qwertyui...",   // API token for public voting endpoints

### Create a census
A census where public keys or token slots (that will eventually contain a public key) are stored. A census can start with 0 items, and public keys can be imported later on.

If census tokens are allocated, users will need to generate a wallet on the frontend and register the public key by themselves. This prevents both the API and the integrator from gaining access to the private key.

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <integrator-key>" https://server/v1/priv/censuses

{
    "name": "2021 members"
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "censusId": "123456789..."
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Add N census tokens (once)

### Get election info – confidential
Provides the details of a confidential voting process if the user holds a wallet that belongs to its census.

If `{electionId}` has been signed by the CSP, then it gets the Vochain parameters, decrypts the metadata and returns it to the caller.

URL Params:

- election-id
- signed-pid: `sign({electionId}, voterPrivK)`
- csp-signature: `sign({electionId}, cspPrivK)`
    - [See here](https://www.notion.so/Vocdoni-API-v1-86357bf911a24e33ab7159a2b6e54632)

### Requesting a census proof
People voting on a signed process will need to package a vote envelope using the result of this call. 

Note: This call does not apply to deployments where a custom CSP validation is being used. 

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/pub/elections/<electionId>/proof
```

#### Request body
```json
{
    "signature": "0x12345678..." // signing a well-known payload using the wallet
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "proof": "..."
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Submitting a vote (signed or blind)

Voters using the tiny JS SDK will get a base64 bundle including the vote and the census proof. This payload is submitted as a base64 string.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/pub/elections/<electionId>/vote
```

#### Request body
```json
{
    "vote": "<base64-signed-vote-transaction>" // see dvote-js
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "nullifier": "0x12345678..."
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Getting a ballot (nullifier)
Voters can check the status of their vote here, and eventually check the explorer link, for independent confirmation.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>


#### Request 
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/pub/nullifiers/<nullifier>
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "electionId": "0x12345678...",
    "registered": true,
    "explorerUrl": "https://vaas.explorer.vote/nullifiers/0x12345678"
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Registering a voter's public key

This process needs to be done by the integrator's frontend, once. 

As soon as a user runs an updated UI version, a new private key should be generated, and the public key should be registered, so that new votes can use this key.

If the wallet is lost, the integrator will need to remove the pubKey from the census and create a new census token when the new wallet is available. 

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/pub/censuses/<censusId>/token
```

#### Request body
```json
{
    "censusToken": "jashdlkfjahs",
    "publicKey": "0x03abcdef0123456789..."
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
// empty response
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"

## Authentication API

**Generic authentication**

---

### Get a shared key to access the private data of an election

The CSP issues a per-process signature whenever the wallet belongs to the process's census. The signature can be used to retrieve confidential information, restricted to only census members.

The voter signs the `electionID` to prove that he/she has a private key within the election census. If everything is correct, the CSP returns `sign({electionId}, cspPrivK)`. 

- election-id
- signed-pid: `sign({electionId}, voterPrivK)`

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/auth/elections/<election-id>/sharedkey
```

#### Request body
```json
{
	"authData": ["<signed-pid>"]
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "sharedkey": "0x1234567890abcde..."
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Get a token for requesting a plain/blind signature

The blind signature process involves a two step interaction.

In the first interaction, the voter proves to have a private key within the election census. If everything is correct, the backend replies with the `tokenR`, which the voter needs to use on the second step. 

- process-id
- signed-pid: `sign({electionId}, voterPrivK)`

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/auth/elections/<election-id>/ecdsa/auth
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/auth/elections/<election-id>/blind/auth
```

#### Request body
```json
{
	"authData": ["<signed-pid>"]
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "tokenR": "0x1234567890abcde..."
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Request the plain/blind signature for an ephemeral wallet

The user generates an ephemeral wallet and the received tokenR to generate a (plain or blinded) payload. This payload is sent to the backend, which will check the correctness and reply with a signature of the payload. 

The voter then may unblind the response (if applicable) and use it as their vote signature. 

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/auth/elections/<electionId>/ecdsa/sign
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/auth/elections/<electionId>/blind/sign
```

#### Request body
```json
{
    "payload": "0xabcdef...",   // hash({electionId, address}) or blind(hash({electionId, address}))
    "tokenR": "0x1234567890abcde..."
}
```
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "signature": "0x1234567890abcde..."  // plain or blind signature
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>

### Get the public keys that have requested a blind signature on an election
For transparency, external observers can request the exhaustive list of public keys that made a blind signature request. 

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>


#### Request 
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/pub/elections/<electionId>/blind/authorized
```

#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "publicKeys": [
        "0x12345678...",
        "0x23456789...",
        ...
    ]
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```
</details>


**Custom authentication API**

---

### Get a shared key to access the private data of an election

This endpoint is conceptually the same as [the one from above](#get-a-token-for-requesting-a-blind-signature). The only difference lies on the custom logic that decides whether a voter is eligible or not.

The CSP issues a per-process signature whenever the wallet belongs to the process's census. The signature can be used to retrieve confidential information, restricted to only census members.

If the evidence provided is correct, the CSP returns `sign({electionId}, cspPrivK)`. 

- election-id
- signed-pid: `sign({electionId}, voterPrivK)`

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

#### Request 
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <organization-api-token>" https://server/v1/auth/elections/<election-id>/sharedkey
```

#### Request body
```json
{
    "authData": ["param1", "param2", ...]
}
#### HTTP 200
```json
{
    "sharedkey": "0x1234567890abcde..."
}
```
#### HTTP 400
```json
{
    "error": "Message goes here"
}
```

### Get a token for requesting a blind signature - custom

This endpoint is conceptually the same as [the one from above](#get-a-token-for-requesting-a-blind-signature). The only difference lies on the custom logic that decides whether a `tokenR` is generated or not.

The blind signature process involves a two step interaction.

In the first interaction, the voter proves their eligibility. If everything is correct, the backend replies with the `tokenR`, which the voter needs to use on [the second step](#request-the-blind-signature-for-the-ephemeral-wallet).

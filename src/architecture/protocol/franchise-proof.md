# Franchise Proof

The franchise proof enables user privacy and allows anonymous voting.

The starting point is a [Merkle Proof](/architecture/census-overview.html#the-census), which efficiently proves that a public key belongs to a Merkle Tree (census). However, using this proof alone would allow the organizer to correlate the vote envelopes with the public key on the database, so that votes wouldn't be secret.

To this end, Vocdoni achieves voting anonymity by the use of ZK-Snarks.

## ZK-Snarks for anonymous voters

Snark stands for *Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge*. In our case, this means proving to someone that we know something, but without revealing it.

In our case:
  1. `Voter` is the owner of the `private key` corresponding to a certain `public key`
  2. `Voter`'s `public key` is included in the `census` Merkle Tree
  3. The nullifier provided by `Voter` uniquely corresponds to his/her `private key` and the `process ID`

Although the computation is CPU and memory intensive, ZK Proofs can be generated from the user client running on modest hardware. The proof is validated by the Vochain Nodes, Miners and any Third Party monitoring the process.

### ZK-Snark circuit

Voters use the proving key generated for the circuit below to generate a ZK Proof. The circuit receives both private and public inputs.

Data that could reveal the identity of the voter are kept private (gray boxes in the diagram). Public inputs are submitted within the Vote Envelope, so that validators can check them against the proof and make sure that the user hasn't voted twice.

+ The same circuit can be used for any `process` with the same census (max) size
+ It relies on a **trusted setup ceremony**

#### Proof generation

The franchise proof is generated by running the ZK-SNARK circuit.

+ **Private inputs:** Private Key, Census Merkle-proof, Vote-signature
+ **Public inputs:** Census Merkle-root, Nullifier, ProcessId, Vote
+ **Output:** Franchise proof

Steps:

1. Vote encryption<br/>
    `encrypted_vote = encrypt( selected_voting_options + random_nonce )`

2. Nullifier generation<br/>
    `nullifier = hash( process_id + user_private_key )`

3. Vote signature<br/>
    `signature = Sign(encrypted_vote)`<br/>
	This signature is required in order to attach the vote to the zk-Proof.

4. Fetch merkle proof<br/>
	From any source that have the census merkle tree such as a Vocdoni Gateway or directly from IPFS.

#### KeyKeepers reveal and commit keys

A set of commitment keys are generated for each election process by a set of trusted identities named `keykeepers`. Only if all `keykeepers` are malicious they might tamper the election, so it is important to make a good distribution of these special identities. Once all these keys are revealed, anyone can generate a valid proof. This mechanism is added to the circuit in order to avoid vote buying when the election is over since a voter will not be able to proof anymore that she is the owner of a specific vote nullifier.

#### Implementation

The zk-Snarks circuit uses circom and can be found [in our github repository](

## Zk-Rollups (proposal) for anti-coercive, scalable and deterministic execution

The approach mentioned above presents an attack vector that could allow for automated vote buying mechanisms, especially for high-stakes elections.

Before an election ends, a user could exhibit their vote to a third party in exchange for a bounty. A buyer would need users to prove that their vote is associated with a given nullifier on the Vochain. This would require the generation of another valid ZK-Proof with the same nullifier as the original vote, but with different contents than the original.

One solution to this problem is to make use of **ZK-Rollups** as a vote aggregation and mixing mechanism between voters and the blockchain. This would make it impossible for any third party to verify that a voter chose a specific option.

Under this proposal, voters submit their encrypted vote envelopes using the same zk-SNARKs circuit as before. But instead of a public blockchain, each envelope is sent to a Rollup Relay through a private transport channel (many could exist). The Rollup Relay then decrypts the aggregated vote envelopes, validates them and computes them in batches (i.e 15 envelopes at a time) to produce a second ZK-Proof. Such a proof can be verified given the list of nullifiers and the aggregated results of the batch.
The new ZK-Proof and the results aggregate is what will be stored in a public blockchain, such as the Vochain or Ethereum.

In this scenario voters are able to verify that their vote has been processed. No outsider, however, can determine what choices were selected by a specific voter. 
At the same time, the election's traceability and transparency properties are preserved.

</div>


**Notes:**

+ In such scenario, the commitment and reveal keys of the previous schema are no longer necessary.
+ The Rollup Relays could potentially exchange private messages in order to announce the nullifiers they are processing (to avoid collisions).
+ Some tuning is still required on this proposal in order to enable elections to be kept "secret until the end", but this feature seems possible.
+ The Rollup Relay network might be incentivized in order to achieve better distribution. A mechanism such as the one implemented on the Hermez.io protocol (based on bidding) might be adopted.

## Linkable Ring Signatures

LRS allow members of a group to sign messages on the group's behalf. The resulting signature does not reveal the signer's identity (preserving anonymity) but at the same time, it is possible to determine whether two signatures have been issued by the same group member or not (linkability).

Unlike ZK Snarks, **LRS do not rely on a trusted setup**.

### How LRS are used in Vocdoni

#### 1. Registration to an organization

First, the Voters need to send their public keys to the Census organization service (each organization can choose which method to use for verifying an identity). This is done just once so the same public key can be used for multiple elections.

```mermaid
graph TD;
C((Organization Census))
V1(Voter)-- send public key -- >C
V2(Voter)-- send public key -- >C
V3(Voter)-- send public key -- >C
```

#### 2. Create census rings

The usage of LRS requires the census to be published, so Voters can create their Rings for casting the vote. The Ring creation follow a set of principles:

+ If Census < 1000, use a single Ring with all existing pubkeys
+ If Census > 1000, census must be split on several groups of keys
	+ the organizer will publish a number (N) which will be used by the voters to know to which group of keys are they assigned by using the following formula: 
	`GroupNumber = VoterPubKey % N`
	+ before publishing N the census must pre-compute all the keys to check that if accomplish the minimum size group of keys. So in case N generates a group with too few, that number must be discarted and try a new one

#### 3. Derivate election keys

In addition to `N`, the Organizer will publish a uniq ID that will identify the election (`processID`). This ID will be used by both parties (Voter and Organizer) to derivate the temporary election public keys using the following mechanism:

+ On ECDSA the PubKey deviates from the PrivKey as follows:
`PubKeyVoter = PrivKeyVoter * G`
+ The Organizer derivate the new temporary PublicKey for each voter this way:
`PubKeyElectionVoter = PubKeyVoter + G*Hash(ElectionID)`
+ Each voter deviates their new Private Key this way: 
`PrivKeyElectionVoter = PrivKeyVoter + Hash(ElectionID)`


#### 4. Start an election and vote

Once the Rings and the temporary keys are published, the Voter can create its Linkable Ring Signature for signing the ballot.

```mermaid
graph BT;
O((Organizer)) -- >|Create new election|B
B[Blockchain] -- >|fetch election ID| C((Census))
B -- >|fetch election ID| V1(Voter 1)

C-.->Pub1["PubKey V1 + electionID"]
C-.->Pub2["PubKey V2 + electionID"]
C-.->Pub3["PubKey V3 + electionID"]

R[Linkable Ring Signature]
V1-.->Priv1["Privkey V1 + electionID"]
Priv1-- >|create election signature| R

subgraph 
Pub1-.-R
Pub2-.-R
Pub3-.-R
end
```

### Javascript example (using RSA)

The Vocdoni platform is designed to work on Ethereum public blockchains, so its users are meant to be using ECDSA key pairs.

As a reference, you can have a look at an RSA implementation: https://github.com/MaiaVictor/lrs

Install via npm
```sh
npm install lrs
```

On `test-node.js` add the following lines and run the script:

```javascript
const lrs = require("lrs");
const NUM_ACCOUNTS = 1000;
const accounts = [];

// parties generate their public/private key pairs
console.time("Generate keys");
for (let i = 0; i < NUM_ACCOUNTS; i++) {
	accounts.push(lrs.gen());
}
console.timeEnd("Generate keys");

// first key is for alice (the real signer)
const alice = accounts[0];

// The list of public key is known and distributed
var group = accounts.map((m) => m.publicKey);
console.log("Group data length:", JSON.stringify(group).length, "bytes");

// Alice signs a message in behalf of one of the group
console.time("Sign ring")
var signed = lrs.sign(group, alice, "The body is buried on the backyard.");
console.timeEnd("Sign ring")

console.log("Signature data length:", signed.length, "bytes");

// Anyone is able to verify *some* of them signed that message
console.time("Verify")
console.log(lrs.verify(group, signed, "The body is buried on the backyard."));
console.timeEnd("Verify")

console.time("Check double sign")
// If that same person signs another message...
var signed2 = lrs.sign(group, alice, "Just kidding, he is alive.");
console.timeEnd("Check double sign")

// We are able to tell the signature came from the same person
console.log(lrs.link(signed, signed2));
```
### On browser

Edit an HTML container:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head></head>

<body>
	<h3>Linkable ring signature</h3>
	<pre id="content"></pre>

	<script src="./test-browser.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

And then edit the `test-browser.js` file:

```javascript
const lrs = require("lrs");
const NUM_ACCOUNTS = 100;
const accounts = [];

// LOGGING SCREEN UTILS

const logMap = {}

function log(text, ...rest) {
	const node = document.querySelector("#content")
	if (node) node.innerText += text + " " + rest.join(" ") + "\n"
	console.log(text, ...rest)
}

function logStart(key) {
	const node = document.querySelector("#content")
	if (logMap[key]) {
		console.warn(`logStart(${key}) is already defined. Overwriting.`)

		logMap[key] = Date.now()
		if (node) node.innerText += key + " [restarted]\n"
	}
	else {
		logMap[key] = Date.now()
		if (node) node.innerText += key + " [started]\n"
		console.log(key + " [started]")
	}
}

function logEnd(key) {
	if (!logMap[key]) {
		const node = document.querySelector("#content")
		if (node) node.innerText += key + " [unstarted]\n"
		console.warn(`logStart(${key}) not started.`)
		return
	}

	const diff = (Date.now() - logMap[key]) / 1000
	const node = document.querySelector("#content")
	if (node) node.innerText += `${key} [done in ${diff.toFixed(1)}s]\n`
	log(`${key} [done in ${diff.toFixed(1)}s]`)
	delete logMap[key]
}

// CODE

function main() {
	// parties generate their public/private key pairs
	logStart("Generate keys");
	for (let i = 0; i < NUM_ACCOUNTS; i++) {
		accounts.push(lrs.gen());
	}
	logEnd("Generate keys");

	// first key is for alice (the real signer)
	const alice = accounts[0];

	// The list of public key is known and distributed
	var group = accounts.map((m) => m.publicKey);

	// Alice signs a message in behalf of one of the group
	logStart("Sign ring")
	var signed = lrs.sign(group, alice, "The body is buried on the backyard.");
	logEnd("Sign ring")

	log("Signature", signed.length);

	// Anyone is able to verify *some* of them signed that message
	logStart("Verify")
	log(lrs.verify(group, signed, "The body is buried on the backyard."));
	logEnd("Verify")

	logStart("Check double sign")
	// If that same person signs another message...
	var signed2 = lrs.sign(group, alice, "Just kidding, he is alive.");
	logEnd("Check double sign")

	// We are able to tell the signature came from the same person
	log(lrs.link(signed, signed2));
}

main();

```

You can use ParcelJS to run the example:

```
npx parcel index.html -p 8080
```

# ZK Census Proof

This document is divided in two sections:
- **[Protocol design](#protocol-design)**: high level overview of the protocol.
- **[Implementation spec](#implementation-spec)**: detailed specification, featuring the relevant data structures, hash functions, etc.

## Protocol design

The census proof (also called franchise proof) enables user privacy and allows for fully anonymous voting.

The starting point is a [Merkle Proof](/architecture/census-overview), which efficiently proves that a voter's public key belongs to a Merkle Tree (census). However, using this proof alone would allow the organizer of a process to correlate each vote envelope with its voter's the public key on the database, so votes wouldn't be secret.

To this end, Vocdoni achieves voting anonymity by the use of ZK-Snarks.

### zkSNARKs for anonymous voters

Snark stands for *Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge*. In our case, this means proving to someone that we know something, but without revealing the contents of what we know.

In our case:
  1. `Voter` is the owner of the `secret key` corresponding to a certain `public key`
  2. `Voter`'s `public key` is included in the `census` Merkle Tree
  3. The nullifier provided by `Voter` uniquely corresponds to their `secret key` and the `process ID` for a specific voting process

Although the computation is CPU and memory intensive, ZK Proofs can be generated from the user client running on modest hardware. The proof is validated by the Vochain Nodes, Miners, and any Third Party monitoring the process.

### zkSNARK circuit

Voters use the proving key generated for the circuit below to generate a ZK Proof. The circuit receives both private and public inputs.

Data that could reveal the identity of the voter are kept private (gray boxes in the diagram). Public inputs are submitted within the Vote Envelope, so that validators can check them against the proof and make sure that the user hasn't voted twice.

+ The same circuit can be used for any `process` with a census size of the same range (10k, 100k, 1M, etc).
+ It relies on a [**trusted setup ceremony**](https://medium.com/qed-it/diving-into-the-snarks-setup-phase-b7660242a0d7)

The circuit above verifies that:
- the prover is the owner of the secret key
- the public key of the secret key is inside a Hash, which is inside the Merkle Tree with the CensusRoot (`key=Poseidon(secretKey), value=0`)
- `H(secretKey, electionID) == nullifier`

#### Proof generation

The franchise proof is generated by running the zkSNARK circuit.

+ **Private inputs:** Private Key, Census Merkle-proof
+ **Public inputs:** Census Merkle-root, Nullifier, ProcessId, Vote
+ **Output:** Franchise proof

Steps:
1. **Vote encryption**
    - `encrypted_vote = encrypt( selected_voting_options + random_nonce )`
2. **Nullifier generation**
    - `nullifier = hash( process_id + user_secret_key )`
3. **Fetch merkle proof**
    - From any source that has the census merkle tree such as a Vocdoni Gateway or directly from IPFS.

0. Circom [circuit](https://github.com/vocdoni/zk-franchise-proof-circuit) is compiled & **Trusted Setup** generated
1. *[O]* Create user **login keys**
    - from csv data (+ user_secret?)
2. *[O]* Build **merkleTree** with login keys
3. *[O+V]* Create **new voting process** (newProcessTx)
4. *[U]* Generate **voting key** (used as leaf key)
    - User's *voting key*: `sk = Hash(login_key | user_secret)`
        - This is the key that will be added into the *CensusTree*
5. *[U+V]* **Register voting key** using **login key** (registerKeyTx)
6. *[V]* Build voting **census merkle tree** (in state)
    - Where each leaf contains the hash of each user's `secretKey` (*voting key*)
    - MerkleTree type: circom compatible
        - Hash function: [Poseidon](https://github.com/iden3/go-iden3-crypto/blob/master/poseidon/poseidon.go)
        - Tree [Go impl](https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-node/blob/master/censustree/arbotree/wrapper.go)
7. *[V]* StartBlock is reached, **election starts**
8. *[V]* Last merkle tree root becomes **censusRoot**
9. *[V+U]* **Get MerkleProof**
    - Vochain will send the *'compressed MerkleProof'* (which are the siblings compressed)
    - Client side will need to 'decompress' it
        - The logic to decompress the siblings [can be found here](https://github.com/vocdoni/arbo/blob/master/tree.go#L606)
        - And [here](https://github.com/vocdoni/arbo/blob/master/tree.go#L577) the explaination of the encoding
10. *[U+G]* **Get ProvingKey & WitnessCalc**
    - *Proving Key & Witness Calc* depend on the circuit being used
11. *[U]* **Generate zkInputs**
    - check the [zkInputs generation](#zkInputs-generation) section for more details
12. *[U]* **Generate zkSNARK proof**
    - using: *zkInputs + Proving Key + Witness Calculator*
13. *[U]* **Cast the vote** with zkSNARK proof
    - contains:
        - *public inputs*
        - *zkProof*
        - *vote*
14. *[V]* **Verify zkSNARK proof**, accept the vote
    - Needs to know:
        - ElectionID
        - Verification Key (depends on the circuit being used (census size))
        - User's *public inputs* + *zkProof*


### Merkle Tree
The MerkleTree needs to be a zkSNARK-friendly implementation. As currently we are using [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) for the zkSNARK circuits, we need to be compatible with the [circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/tree/master/circuits/smt) MerkleTree implementation. A specification of the MerkleTree [can be found here](https://docs.iden3.io/publications/pdfs/Merkle-Tree.pdf).

In the Vochain, we're using the [arbo](https://github.com/vocdoni/arbo) MerkleTree, which is a Go implementation compatible with the Circom spec.

The MerkleTree uses the Poseidon hash, which is a 'snark-friendly' hash function that later on can be proved inside a circuit without requiring too many constraints.

The following diagram contains a visual representation of the data structure of the Leaves of the MerkleTree being used in the scheme of the zk-census-proof.

### zkInputs generation
```json
// Example of zkInputs
{
	"censusRoot": "51642541620950251760298704744678482162425252475654827255045491135352807540162",
	"censusSiblings": ["0","0","0","0"],
	"secretKey": "6190793965647866647574058687473278714480561351424348391693421151024369116465",
	"voteValue": "1",
	"electionId": "10",
	"nullifier": "1938187656076799017313903315498318464349291455761501098436114043715056719301",
}
```

Origin of each zkInput parameter:
> *all the parameters are `string` or `[]string` that represent `bigInt` or `[]bigInt`*
- *censusRoot*: computed by the *CensusAuthority* from the *Census Tree*
- *censusSiblings*: computed by the *CensusAuthority*, is the *Merkle Proof*
    - the *User* retrieves the *siblings* from the *Vochain* through the *Gateway*
    - the length of *censusSiblings* will depend on the *zkCircuit*:
        - The design of the *MerkleTree* used in circomlib provokes different lengths in the siblings returned when generating a *MerkleProof*
	  - This is due the design of the *MerkleTree* defines a tree in which the deep of the tree (from the root to the leafs) will depend on each leaf and its neighbours. More details can be found in the [*MerkleTree* spec](https://docs.iden3.io/publications/pdfs/Merkle-Tree.pdf).
        - In order to input those siblings into the circuit, the `nLevels` of the circuit is fixed, so the length of *siblings* needs to be fixed also.
        - So, the len(siblings) will depend on the *zkCircuit* being used, specifically from the `nLevels` parameter of the circuit
        - The logic needed to be implemented in the User side can be found [here (go) lines 67-70](https://github.com/vocdoni/zk-franchise-proof-circuit/blob/feature/go-code-inputs-generation/test/go-inputs-generator/census_test.go#L67), and [here (js) line 23](https://github.com/vocdoni/zk-franchise-proof-circuit/blob/feature/go-code-inputs-generation/src/franchise.js#L33):
            - `while (siblings.length < this.levels) siblings.push(BigInt(0));`
- *secretKey*: generated by the *User*
- *voteValue*: value of the *User* vote
- *electionId*: the election ID in which the *User* is participating
- *nullifier*: computed by *User*
    - `nullifier = poseidon.Hash(sk, electionID)`

### Circuit identification
There will be different circuits of the `zk-census-proof` depending on the census size, also there could be more use cases with different circuit designs.
Both the client and the Vochain need a way to univocally identify those circuits, in order to user the proper `Proving key`, `Witness calculator` and `Verification key` for each circuit.

Circuits are identified across the stack by using a Protobuf enum type. Each `ProofZkSNARK` protobuf package will have a `Type` identifier indicating which circuit the proof belongs to, so the Vochain knows which `Verification Key` to use for verifying the proof.

Format: `CIRCUITNAME_PARAMETER1_PARAMETER2`

List of current types:
- `ZKCENSUSPROOF_NLEVELS`
    - Circuit name: [`ZKCENSUSPROOF`](https://github.com/vocdoni/zk-franchise-proof-circuit/blob/master/circuits/census.circom)
    - Parameters: `nLevels`
    - Example:
        - `ZKCENSUSPROOF_100`
        - `ZKCENSUSPROOF_1000`


# Annex
#### KeyKeepers reveal and commit keys

A set of commitment keys are generated for each election process by a set of trusted identities named `keykeepers`. Only if all `keykeepers` are malicious could they tamper with the election, so it is crucial to distribute these special identities well. Once all these keys are revealed, anyone can generate a valid proof. This mechanism is added to the circuit in order to avoid vote buying when the election is over. Since anyone can now generate a valid proof, a voter will no longer be able to prove that they are the owner of a specific vote nullifier.

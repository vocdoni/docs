# How We Work

## Ideals

We share very strong ideals among us

- We want **effective** change in how civil society organizes **itself**
- Decentralization is the way to change, but we're aware that its a bumpy and long road, and taking straight paths is sometimes needed
- Transparency above anything
- Trust before hierarchies
- We believe in an open-source approach to creation
- We don't sell, nor over-promise. Instead, we communicate things as we see them, including pros and cons

## Balance

We strive for a sustainable work-life balance

- We encourage the use of working hours to learn things related to out work and our collective mission.
- We encourage a balanced lifestyle and we suggest a daily average of 7 working hours
- We adapt to everyone's needs and motivations

## Coordination

- We are fully autonomous and responsible individuals. Therefore nobody mandates days, schedules, or hours that you work
- We don't like official processes, but we're not afraid when they are needed
- We are a fully remote team. We have a bi-monthly retreat for team building

## Development practices

- Open-source everything
- Test-driven development
- Integration and unit testing
- Well-documented and maintained APIs
- Well-documented reasoning behind decisions

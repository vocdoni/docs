# Process Data Schemes

As stated before, governance processes span across the [Process Smart Contract](/architecture/smart-contracts/process), the [Vochain](/architecture/services/vochain) and distributed file storage, providing the human readable metadata. 

Along the different stages of a governance process, the following data schemes are used:

- [Process metadata](#process-metadata)
- [Vote Envelope](#vote-envelope)
- [Vote Package](#vote-package)
- [Results](#results)
<!-- - [Support multi-layer vote encryption](#support-multi-layer-vote-encryption) -->

## Process Metadata

The creation of this data structure is critical. Multiple checks should be in place to ensure that the data is coherent (well formatted, all relevant locales present, etc).

The metadata of a process is represented as follows:

```json
{
    "version": "1.1", // Protocol version
    "title": {
        "en": "Universal Basic Income",
        "ca": "Renda Bàsica Universal"
    },
    "description": {
        "en": "## Markdown text goes here\n### Abstract",
        "ca": "## El markdown va aquí\n### Resum"
    },
    "media": {
        "header": "<content uri>",
        "streamUri": "https://.../"
    },
    "questions": [
        {
            "title": {
                "en": "Should universal basic income become a human right?",
                "ca": "Estàs d'acord amb que la renda bàsica universal sigui un dret humà?"
            },
            "description": {
                "en": "## Markdown text goes here\n### Abstract",
                "ca": "## El markdown va aquí\n### Resum"
            },
            "choices": [
                {
                    "title": {
                        "en": "Yes",
                        "ca": "Sí"
                    },
                    "value": 0
                },
                {
                    "title": {
                        "en": "No",
                        "ca": "No"
                    },
                    "value": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Vote Envelope

The Vote Envelope contains a (possibly encrypted) Vote Package and provides the details to check that the incoming vote is valid. Some fields may be optional depending on the process `mode` and `envelopeType`.

##### When `envelopeType.ANONYMOUS` is enabled

An anonymous Vote Envelope features the proces ID, the ZK Proof, a nonce to prevent replay attacks, the user's nullifier for the vote, the index of the encryption keys used and a base64 representation of the Vote Package.

```json
{
    "processId": "0x1234567890...",  // The process for which the vote is casted
    "proof": "0x1234...",  // ZK Proof
    "nonce": "1234567890",  // Unique number per vote attempt, so that replay attacks can't reuse this payload
    "nullifier": "0x1234...",   // Hash of the private key + processId
    "encryptionKeyIndexes": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],  // (optional) On encrypted votes, contains the (sorted) indexes of the keys used to encrypt
    "votePackage": "base64-vote-package"  // base64(jsonString) or base64( encrypt(jsonString) )
}
```

The `nullifier` uniquely identifies the vote in the blockchain and it is computed as follows: 

`nullifier = keccak256(bytes(hex(addr(signature))) + bytes(hex(processId)))`

##### When `envelopeType.ANONYMOUS` is disabled

A signed (non-anonymous) Vote Envelope features the process ID, the Census Merkle Proof of the user, a nonce to prevent replay attacks, the index of the encryption keys used, a Base64 representation of the Vote Package and the user's signature.

As always, the signature should be generated from a JSON object containing the keys in ascending alphabetical order.

```json
{
    "processId": "0x1234567890...",
    "proof": "0x1234...",  // Merkle Proof of the voter's public key
    "nonce": "1234567890",  // Unique number per vote attempt, so that replay attacks can't reuse this payload
    "encryptionKeyIndexes": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],  // (optional) On encrypted polls, contains the (sorted) indexes of the keys used to encrypt
    "votePackage": "base64-vote-package",  // base64(jsonString) or base64( encrypt(jsonString) )
    "signature": "0x12345678...",  // sign( JSON.stringify( { processId, proof, nonce, encryptionKeyIndexes?, votePackage } ), privateKey )
}
```

## Vote Package

Contains the actual votes and is part of the Vote Envelope.

```json
{
    "nonce": "01234567890abcdef", // 8+ byte random string to prevent guessing the encrypted payload before the reveal key is released
    "votes": [  // Direclty mapped to the `questions` field of the metadata
        1, 3, 2
    ]
}
```

##### When `envelopeType.ENCRYPTED_VOTE` is disabled
- The `nonce` can be omitted.
- The package must be used as a plain base-64 string.

##### When `envelopeType.ENCRYPTED_VOTE` is enabled
- The `nonce` is mandatory. Can be omitted otherwise.
- The package must be encrypted with the public keys used in ascending order.
- The package must be a base64 representation of the encrypted bytes.

## Results

Requests to the Results API will return an Array of number arrays. They will contain the number of occurrences of every possible vote option, for every question available.

Given diferent process with various parameters, below is an example of the results that would be returned given the votes of 3 users.
